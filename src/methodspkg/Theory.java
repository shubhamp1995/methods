				+"in order to called the non static regular method we have to create an object or intsance first."
				+"why there is need to crete an object or instance to called non static method from the same classs or diff class.\n"
				+"ans is - because they can be created to call a non static method or function which are not present inside the main.\n"
				+"method but present inside the class and also provide the name to the space which is being used to store the data.\n"
				+"why we are not creating any object for static regular method?.\n"
				+"the ans is - because it is part of the class rather than the object of that class.\n"
				+"only static data can be asscessed by static methods.\n"
				+"however non static static methods can only be asscessed by creating an instance or object of that class");
